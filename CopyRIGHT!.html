								<h2>About Copyright</h2>
								<p> Copyright is exactly what its name implies: "the right to copy". It refers to the legal rights of the owners of intellectual property. By law, copyright strives to protect creators from unauthorized use and distribution, or to put it simply, it protects original works of creators from thieves.<br><br> As of today, development of creative works continue to grow wide in variety. As a result, copyright must continue to broaden and strengthen its area of protection. Now works such as website contents, computer softwares, graphic designs and even architectural works created by students are being protected by Copyright.<br> <br> Although, one of the biggest misconception about copyright is that it includes ideas, discoveries, facts or theories, which it does not. Copyright does protects published and unpublishes works, but it doesn't ensure the protection of the idea in your artistic work. Copyright protects the essence, expression, arrangement ,or presentation of one's ideas. Nonetheless, copyright exists simply to protect and ensure that original creator's efforts are recognized, respected and fairly compensated.</p>
								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p> The concept of copyright has evolved over centuries. It traces back to ancient times when certain privileges were granted to creators in ancient Greece and Rome. The modern concept of copyright emerged in England during the 16th century with the printing press. The Statute of Anne in 1710 is often regarded as the first copyright law, which granted authors rights to their works for a fixed period. <br> In the United States, the Copyright Clause of the Constitution (1787) empowered Congress to promote the progress of science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries. <br>
									Over time, copyright laws have been amended and expanded to accommodate new technologies and creative mediums. International treaties and agreements, such as the Berne Convention (1886) and the TRIPS Agreement (1994), have also played a significant role in harmonizing copyright laws across different countries. ©</p>

								<h2>Protection From Plagiarism</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic19.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Do's and Don'ts</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic20.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In terms of do's and don'ts of copyright, it's essential to respect the rights of creators by not reproducing or distributing their work without permission. This includes both commercial and non-commercial use.</p>
								<h3>Do's</h3>
								<p>1.  Seek permission before using copyrighted material. <br><br>
									2.  Utilize works that are no longer under copyright protection. <br><br>
									3.  Properly attribute works you use, even if not legally required. <br><br>
									4.  Familiarize yourself with fair use/fair dealing laws to responsibly use copyrighted material. <br><br>
									5.  When in doubt, seek legal counsel to ensure compliance with copyright laws.</p>
								<h3>Don'ts</h3>
								<p>1.Avoid copying or passing off someone else's work as your own. <br><br>
									2.  Don't distribute copyrighted material without proper authorization. <br><br>
									3.  Refrain from altering copyrighted works without permission from the creator. <br><br>
									4.  Respect copyright notices and permissions associated with content. <br><br>
									5.  Don't assume a work is in the public domain without verifying its copyright status.
									</p>
								<h2>Proper way of Crediting the Author</h2>
								<p>Properly crediting the author is crucial when using someone else's work. This involves acknowledging the creator and the source of the material. Giving proper credit not only respects the author's rights but also helps to maintain transparency and integrity in the creative community.</p>
								<h2>Awareness</h2>
								<p>Copyright is essential for ensuring creators' rights to their creative property. It gives creators control over how their work is used, distributed, and monetized, which promotes creativity and innovation by incentivizing producers to create new works. Copyright also helps to protect the integrity of creative works and promotes the spread of information and culture by establishing a balance between creators' rights and the public interest.</p>

								<h2>What is Copyright?</h2>
								<p>Copyright refers to the legal right of the owner of intellectual property. In simpler terms, copyright is the right to copy. This means that the original creators of products and anyone they give authorization to are the only ones with the exclusive right to reproduce the work.</p>
								<h2> Who is a copyright owner?</h2>
								<p> Everyone is a copyright owner. Once you create an original work and fix it, like taking a photograph, writing a poem or blog, or recording a new song, you are the author and the owner. Companies, organizations, and other people besides the work’s creator can also be copyright owners. Copyright law allows ownership through “works made for hire,” which establishes that works created by an employee within the scope of employment are owned by the employer. The work made for hire doctrine also applies to certain independent contractor relationships, for certain types of commissioned works. Copyright ownership can also come from contracts like assignments or from other types of transfers like wills and bequests.</p>
								<h2> What is Fair-Use?</h2>
								<p>Fair use is a doctrine in copyright law that allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the copyright owner. Fair use purposes may include criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. Determining fair use involves considering factors such as the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect of the use on the potential market for the copyrighted work. </p>
								<h2>When can I use works that are not mine?</h2>
								<p>It is important to know that we are all also copyright users. When we read books, watch movies, listen to music, or use videogames or software, we are using copyright-protected works. <br> So, even if you are not the owner of a work, you still may be able to use it. In addition to buying or licensing works (or some other way of seeking permission to use the work), you can also use one of the Copyright Act’s exceptions and limitations, or rely on works in the public domain.</p>
								<h2>what is Digital Copyright?</h2>
								<p>With the advent of digital technology, copyright law has adapted to address issues such as digital rights management (DRM), online piracy, and the distribution of digital works over the internet. Digital copyright issues include the protection of digital content, the enforcement of copyright in online environments, and the liability of internet service providers for hosting infringing content. </p>
								<h2>International Copyright Protection</h2>
								<p> Various international treaties and agreements, such as the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works and the WIPO Copyright Treaty, establish minimum standards of copyright protection and facilitate cooperation among countries to protect the rights of creators and copyright holders globally.</p>
								<h2>Public Domain</h2>
								<p>Once copyright expires or if the creator explicitly places the work in the public domain, the work becomes part of the public domain, meaning it can be freely used by anyone for any purpose without permission. Public domain works are not protected by copyright and can be used, copied, and distributed without restriction.</p>
								<h2>(DMCA) or Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h2>
								<p>The DMCA is a United States copyright law that criminalizes the production and dissemination of technology, devices, or services intended to circumvent measures that control access to copyrighted works. It also provides a safe harbor for online service providers from copyright infringement liability for user-generated content under certain conditions.</p>
								<h2>How long does copyright protection last?</h2>
								<p>Copyright protection lasts for a specific duration, which varies depending on several factors including the type of work and the country's copyright laws. In general, for works created after January 1, 1978, in the United States, copyright protection lasts for the life of the author plus 70 years after their death. <br><br>If a work has more than one author, the term extends 70 years after the last surviving author's death. For works made for hire, anonymous works, or pseudonymous works, copyright protection lasts for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 years from the date of creation, whichever is shorter. </p>
								<h2>What is Orphan Works?</h2>
								<p>Orphan works are copyrighted works whose owners are unknown or cannot be located. The existence of orphan works can pose challenges for individuals and institutions seeking to use, reproduce, or distribute these works legally. Some jurisdictions have introduced legislation to address the issue of orphan works and facilitate their lawful use.</p>
